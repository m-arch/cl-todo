cl-todo
=======

A simple todo, written in Common Lisp

To load the project, download and unzip/untar.
I am using mysql database, to correctly be able to compile the project, the database marcdb should be created using

mysql> create database marcdb;

Browse to the folder directory and compile or push to asdf "themouallem.asd"

Go to http:://localhost:8080
